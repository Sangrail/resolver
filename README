1. DESCRIPTION

This is a simple dependency container for C++, which allows you to use the inversion of control (IoC) pattern in your applications.

2. INSTALLATION

The container requires no installation, just include the "container.hpp" file in your source code.

There is also an example test application container_test.cpp which you can build with "make".

3. USAGE

Inversion of control (IoC) is about decoupling the class from its dependencies. Suppose you have a class that does some logging:

class Foo {
    private:
    Logger *logger;
    public:
    Foo() {
        logger = new Logger();
    }
    void doSomethig() {
        this->logger->log("done");
    }
}

This class is strongly tied to concrete logger instance, which means that:
1) it and will require refactoring in case of using a different logger,
2) writng unit tests for this class will be very hard, if not impossible.

Much more sane implementation would look as follows:

class ILogger() {
    virtual void log(std::string s) = 0;
};

class Logger : public ILogger() {
    void log(std::string s) {
        /* implementation goes here */
    }
};

class Foo {
    private:
    ILogger *logger;
    public:
    Foo(ILogger *l) {
        logger = l;
    }
    void doSomethig() {
        this->logger->log("done");
    }
}

Now you can inject (hence term "dependency injection" used together with IoC) a different logger instances, depending on your needs: FileLogger, NetworkLogger, etc.
Also, writing unit tests is possible, because you can use a class like FakeLogger which has empty log(std::string) method, or does some assertions inside.

If you have a lot of classes, it is tedious to instantiate all of them with proper dependencies:

Foo *foo1 = new Foo(new FileLogger());
...
Foo *foo2 = new Foo(new FileLogger());

So you can use a container to keep the dependencies:

class Foo {
    private:
    ILogger *logger;
    public:
    Foo() {
        logger = ioc::Container::Resolve<ILogger>();
    }
    void doSomethig() {
        this->logger->log("done");
    }
}

ioc::Container::Register<ILogger>(new FileLogger());
...
Foo *foo1 = new Foo();
...
Foo *foo2 = new Foo();

Check out the container_test.cpp for a complete example implementation.
